// objective: return all the unique characters that exist in a string passed into the function.  The program should also report back how many instances of each letter were found in the string.

// a countLetters function that takes a string as a parameter that returns an object
    // make an empty object that we'll fill
    // ignore spaces in the passed-in string
    // for each of the characters in the string
        // if the letter has already been seen
            // add one to the count for that letter in the object
        // otherwise
            // add that letter to the object and set its count to one
    // return the object

// display the object to the user
